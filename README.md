# video encoding demo

This is a library that will encode videos using [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)

This repo also includes 3 demos using this library.<br>
Two where the frame images are static and one where the images are rendered in real time by [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)

I might add more to this later and turn it into something usable later.
